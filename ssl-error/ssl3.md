Let me help you with this SSL handshake exception. This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the security requirements of your Java application and the key exchange parameters offered by the server.

Here's what's happening:
1. Your Java client is trying to establish a secure connection using SSL/TLS
2. The server is offering a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange with parameters that don't meet Java's security constraints
3. This causes Java to reject the connection attempt

Here are a few ways to resolve this:

1. Update the server's configuration (if you control it):
```java
// Increase DH key size to at least 2048 bits
dhparam=2048
```

2. Modify Java security properties (if you can't change the server):
```java
// Add to java.security file or programmatically
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=DH keySize < 1024
```

3. Programmatic solution in your code:
```java
Security.setProperty("jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms", 
    "SSLv3, RC4, DES, MD5withRSA, DH keySize < 1024");
```

Would you like me to explain any of these solutions in more detail or help you implement a specific fix?
