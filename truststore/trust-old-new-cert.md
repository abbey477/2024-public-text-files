# Option 2: Trust Both Certificates During Transition

When a server is rotating certificates, there's often a transition period where both the old and new certificates might be active. To ensure uninterrupted service during this period, you can configure your Java client to trust both certificates simultaneously.

Here's a more detailed explanation of how to implement this approach:

## Step 1: Obtain Both Certificates
First, you need to have both the old and new server certificates available:
- The old certificate that your application already trusts
- The new certificate that the server will be transitioning to

## Step 2: Create/Update a Trust Store with Both Certificates
You'll use the Java `keytool` utility to manage the certificates in your trust store:

```bash
# Import the old certificate (if not already in the trust store)
keytool -importcert -alias oldservercert -file old_cert.cer -keystore truststore.jks

# Import the new certificate with a different alias
keytool -importcert -alias newservercert -file new_cert.cer -keystore truststore.jks
```

## Step 3: Configure Your Java Client to Use This Trust Store

```java
// Load the trust store containing both certificates
KeyStore trustStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("path/to/truststore.jks")) {
    trustStore.load(fis, "truststore_password".toCharArray());
}

// Create a trust manager that uses this trust store
TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
tmf.init(trustStore);

// Create an SSL context with these trust managers
SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
sslContext.init(null, tmf.getTrustManagers(), new SecureRandom());

// Use this SSL context for HTTPS connections
HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection) new URL("https://example.com").openConnection();
connection.setSSLSocketFactory(sslContext.getSocketFactory());
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Zero Downtime**: Your application continues to function regardless of which certificate (old or new) the server presents
2. **Gradual Transition**: Works well with server-side certificate rotation strategies where the transition happens gradually
3. **Simplified Deployment**: You can update your client application's trust store before the server actually rotates the certificate

## Considerations

1. **Security**: Having multiple trusted certificates slightly increases your trust surface area - only include certificates you genuinely trust
2. **Maintenance**: After the transition period, you should remove the old certificate from your trust store for better security hygiene
3. **Certificate Expiration**: Remember that the old certificate will eventually expire - ensure your application doesn't fail due to expired certificates in the trust store

This approach is particularly useful in enterprise environments where you control both the server and client, and can coordinate the certificate rotation process across your infrastructure.
