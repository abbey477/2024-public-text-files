I'll help you set up JaCoCo code coverage for both dev and prod environments using the Maven plugin in a single pom.xml file.

### How to Use This Configuration:

1. **Environment Selection**:
   - The `dev` profile is active by default
   - To run with the prod profile: `mvn verify -Pprod`

2. **Reports Location**:
   - Dev coverage: `target/site/jacoco-dev/`
   - Prod coverage: `target/site/jacoco-prod/`
   - Aggregate coverage: `target/site/jacoco-aggregate/`

3. **Key Features**:
   - Separate coverage files for dev and prod environments
   - Merged report that combines both environments
   - Configurable coverage thresholds (currently set to 70% instruction coverage)
   - Integration with Surefire (unit tests) and Failsafe (integration tests) plugins

4. **Customization Options**:
   - Adjust the coverage thresholds in the `check` execution
   - Modify the report destinations in the properties section
   - Add more coverage rules for different code elements (class, method, etc.)

You can integrate this configuration into your existing pom.xml by copying the relevant sections. The setup uses Maven profiles to switch between environments while maintaining separate coverage data for each.

I'll update the configuration to make the prod profile the default instead of dev.

I've updated the configuration to make the prod profile the default instead of dev. Now:

1. The prod environment will be used by default when you run Maven commands
2. To use the dev environment, you'll need to explicitly activate it with: `mvn verify -Pdev`
3. Running `mvn verify` without any profile flag will now use the prod configuration

The rest of the JaCoCo setup remains unchanged, maintaining separate coverage files for both environments and an aggregate report combining them.

I'll update the JaCoCo configuration to use the "instrument" method for production instead of the default "on-the-fly" approach. This can be beneficial for production environments as it provides better performance and more control.

I've updated the JaCoCo configuration to use the instrumentation method for the production environment. Here are the key changes:

1. **Instrumentation Approach**:
   - Replaced `prepare-agent` with `instrument` and `restore-instrumented-classes` goals
   - The instrument goal modifies class files during the build process rather than using runtime agents
   - This approach offers better performance for production environments

2. **Build Process Changes**:
   - Instrumentation happens during the `process-classes` phase
   - Original classes are restored after testing with `restore-instrumented-classes`
   - Coverage data is automatically collected in `${project.build.directory}/jacoco.exec`

3. **Removed Agent Configuration**:
   - Removed the agent argument line from the Failsafe plugin
   - Instrumentation doesn't require JVM arguments to collect coverage

This setup gives you:
- Potentially better performance in production
- Less runtime overhead
- More control over which classes are instrumented

The dev environment still uses the on-the-fly approach with the agent, while prod now uses the offline instrumentation method. The aggregate report will still combine data from both environments.
