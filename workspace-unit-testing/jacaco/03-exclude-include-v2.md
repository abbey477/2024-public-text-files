For Spring Boot applications, you can exclude Java classes from the JaCoCo coverage report by configuring the JaCoCo Maven plugin in your pom.xml file. Here's how to do it specifically for a Spring Boot project:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
    <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.10</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>report</id>
            <phase>prepare-package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>report</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <excludes>
                    <!-- Common Spring Boot exclusion patterns -->
                    <exclude>**/Application.class</exclude>
                    <exclude>**/config/**</exclude>
                    <exclude>**/model/**</exclude>
                    <exclude>**/entity/**</exclude>
                    <exclude>**/dto/**</exclude>
                    
                    <!-- Specific classes to exclude -->
                    <exclude>com/example/myapp/SomeSpecificClass.class</exclude>
                    
                    <!-- Exclude by pattern matching -->
                    <exclude>**/*DTO.class</exclude>
                    <exclude>**/*Config.class</exclude>
                    <exclude>**/*Constants.class</exclude>
                </excludes>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

Some Spring Boot specific tips:

1. It's common to exclude the main Application class that contains the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation since it often has little testable logic.

2. You might want to exclude auto-generated classes, especially if you're using tools like Lombok, MapStruct, or JPA repositories:
   ```xml
   <exclude>**/*MapperImpl.class</exclude>
   <exclude>**/generated/**</exclude>
   ```

3. For excluding all classes in specific packages that follow Spring Boot conventions:
   ```xml
   <exclude>**/domain/**</exclude>
   <exclude>**/repository/**</exclude>  <!-- If you're only testing via integration tests -->
   <exclude>**/exception/**</exclude>
   ```

4. Make sure the JaCoCo plugin works well with Spring Boot by placing it in the correct build phase. The example above uses `prepare-package` which works well with the Spring Boot Maven plugin.

5. If you're using Spring Boot's test slicing annotations like `@WebMvcTest` or `@DataJpaTest`, you might want to ensure your coverage configuration is compatible with those test types.

This configuration should work with the standard Spring Boot Maven setup without requiring additional changes.
