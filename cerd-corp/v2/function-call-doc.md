I'll create a simple shell script that demonstrates how to define functions, pass multiple parameters to a main function, and then call other functions. Here's a straightforward example:

In this example, I've created a shell script with a clear structure that demonstrates:

1. Three simple functions:
   - `greet`: Takes a name parameter and outputs a greeting
   - `calculate_sum`: Takes two numbers and outputs their sum
   - `show_date`: Displays the current date

2. A `main` function that:
   - Takes four parameters (username, two numbers, and a yes/no flag)
   - Calls the other functions with appropriate parameters
   - Includes conditional logic to only call `show_date` if specified

3. Two examples of calling the main function:
   - Direct parameter passing with literals
   - Commented example showing how to pass variables

To run this script:
1. Save it to a file (e.g., `functions.sh`)
2. Make it executable with `chmod +x functions.sh`
3. Run it with `./functions.sh`

This pattern is useful for organizing shell scripts, especially as they grow in complexity. The main function serves as an entry point that coordinates the flow of operations.
