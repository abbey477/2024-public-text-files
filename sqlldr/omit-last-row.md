The `head -n -1 original.csv > modified.csv` command is a useful shell command for removing the last line of a file. Let me break down how it works:

- `head`: This is a command-line utility that outputs the first part of files
- `-n -1`: This is an option for the `head` command:
  - `-n` specifies the number of lines
  - `-1` (with the minus sign) tells `head` to output all lines except the last 1 line
- `original.csv`: The input file
- `>`: Redirection operator that sends the output to a file
- `modified.csv`: The output file where the result is saved

In essence, this command reads the original CSV file, outputs all except the last line, and saves the result to a new file called "modified.csv". 

This is particularly useful for data processing when you need to remove footer rows, summary lines, or other information that might be present at the end of your CSV file before loading it with SQL*Loader.

The advantage of this approach is its simplicity - it works regardless of the content of the last row, so you don't need to create specific WHEN conditions in your control file.
