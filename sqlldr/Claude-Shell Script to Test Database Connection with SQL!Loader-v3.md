 I'll refactor the examples to create shell scripts that accept CSV files and control files as parameters. This will make the scripts more flexible and reusable.

I've refactored the script into a single, flexible utility that accepts CSV files and control files as parameters. This approach provides several advantages:

1. **More Reusable**: You can test any CSV and control file combination without modifying the script
2. **Better Command-Line Interface**: Uses standard command-line parameters for easy integration
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Creates detailed logs of both the CSV parsing and connection test

Here's how to use the script:

```bash
./sqlldr_test.sh --csv your_data.csv --ctl your_control.ctl --db username/password@database
```

Key features of this refactored script:

1. **Accepts Parameters**:
   - `-c, --csv`: The CSV file to parse and validate
   - `-t, --ctl`: The SQL*Loader control file
   - `-d, --db`: Database connection string
   - `-o, --output`: Custom log file name
   - `-r, --rows`: Number of rows to process (default is 0 for connection test only)

2. **Intelligent CSV Parsing**:
   - Automatically detects delimiters and quote characters from the control file
   - Extracts field names from the control file
   - Parses and displays the CSV data for validation

3. **Database Connection Testing**:
   - Tests the connection using the provided parameters
   - Reports detailed connection status
   - Includes the full SQL*Loader log in the output

4. **Helpful Examples**:
   - When run without parameters, shows usage examples
   - Creates sample CSV and control files for reference

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `sqlldr_test.sh`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x sqlldr_test.sh`
3. Run it with your files:
   ```bash
   ./sqlldr_test.sh --csv your_data.csv --ctl your_control.ctl --db username/password@database
   ```

The script will:
1. Parse your CSV file and show what would be inserted
2. Test the database connection using SQL*Loader
3. Generate a comprehensive log file with all details

For simple connection testing, just use `--rows 0` (which is the default). If you want to validate the actual data loading, you can specify a small number of rows to process, such as `--rows 5`.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this script in more detail?

## Prompt:
keep the example simple

## Response:
 I'll create a much simpler script that focuses on the core functionality of testing database connections with SQL*Loader while parsing a CSV file.

I've created a much simpler script that focuses on the essentials: testing database connections with SQL*Loader and logging the CSV parsing results.

### How to Use the Script

```bash
./sqlldr_test.sh data.csv data.ctl username/password@database
```

### Key Features

1. **Simple Parameters**: 
   - First argument: CSV file path
   - Second argument: Control file path
   - Third argument: Database connection string

2. **Basic CSV Validation**:
   - Logs the first 5 rows of the CSV file for quick validation
   - Includes the full control file contents in the log

3. **Connection Testing**:
   - Tests the database connection using SQL*Loader with `rows=0`
   - No data is actually loaded into the database
   - Reports clear success/failure status

4. **Comprehensive Logging**:
   - Creates a timestamped log file
   - Includes CSV sample, control file, and connection results
   - Captures the full SQL*Loader output

The script is straightforward and handles the core requirements:
1. Tests database connection using SQL*Loader
2. Validates CSV file structure 
3. Logs everything to a file for review

This script keeps things simple while providing all the information needed to validate both the connection and CSV parsing without actually modifying any database tables.

Would you like me to explain any part of this simplified script further?
