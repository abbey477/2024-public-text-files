 I'll update the scripts to include an SQL insert query in a log file for validation purposes, while still ensuring no actual data is inserted into the database.

I've updated all the test scripts to include SQL insert queries in log files for validation purposes. Each script now:

1. Creates a validation SQL file containing insert statements that would be executed in a real data loading scenario
2. Saves these SQL statements to a dedicated log file
3. Keeps the logs after execution for review

Here's what each validation log contains:

1. **Basic Connection Test**:
   - A simple `INSERT INTO dummy_table` statement
   - Connection string details
   - Test results showing if the connection succeeded

2. **Connection Test with Timeout**:
   - An insert statement with multiple fields and a SYSDATE reference
   - Timeout settings used in the test
   - Connection status and any error details

3. **Multiple Connection Test**:
   - Insert statements for each database being tested
   - Shows what would be inserted if loading was performed
   - Maintains a comprehensive report of all connection attempts

4. **TNS Connection Test**:
   - More complex SQL including an INSERT with sequence
   - Additional diagnostic queries that would be used in a real scenario
   - Queries to check user account status and tablespace availability

5. **SQL*Loader Version Check**:
   - Validation SQL with database version queries
   - SQL that would insert the version information into a tracking table
   - Version compatibility checks

Key features of these updated scripts:

- All logs explicitly state that the SQL is "for verification purposes only (not executed)"
- No data is actually inserted into any tables during testing
- The SQL queries serve as documentation of what a real load operation would do
- Each test maintains its own separate log file with detailed information
- All temporary files are cleaned up, but logs are preserved for review

These validation logs would be valuable for audit purposes, allowing DBAs to verify that:
1. The connection testing was performed
2. The proper database accounts were tested
3. The SQL statements intended for execution are correct

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of the validation logs in more detail?

## Response:
 I understand now - you want the script to parse a CSV file and output the parsed data to a log file for validation, without actually inserting it into the database. Let me update the script to demonstrate this approach.

I've completely rewritten the scripts to focus on parsing CSV files and outputting the parsed data to log files for validation, while still testing database connections. Here's what each script does:

1. **Basic Connection Test with CSV Parsing**:
   - Creates a sample CSV file with employee data
   - Parses the CSV file line by line using bash
   - Outputs each parsed row to a log file
   - Generates the SQL statements that would be executed (but aren't)
   - Tests the database connection with SQL*Loader

2. **Complex CSV Parsing**:
   - Handles a more complex CSV with quoted fields
   - Demonstrates how SQL*Loader would handle date conversions
   - Creates a detailed parse log showing the original data and corresponding SQL
   - Tests the database connection without loading any data

3. **Multiple Database Connection Test**:
   - Uses a CSV file to define multiple database connections to test
   - Parses the configuration CSV and outputs details to a log
   - Tests connections to each database listed in the CSV
   - Logs success/failure for each connection attempt

4. **CSV Format Detection and Validation**:
   - Handles different CSV formats (comma, tab, semicolon delimiters)
   - Automatically detects the delimiter used in each file
   - Generates appropriate SQL*Loader control files for each format
   - Parses and validates each format, producing detailed logs
   - Tests database connections with the correct format settings

5. **SQL*Loader Version Check**:
   - Simple utility to check and log the SQL*Loader client version

Key features of these scripts:

- Each script creates CSV validation logs that show exactly how the data would be parsed
- The logs include the SQL statements that would be executed in a real load operation
- No data is actually loaded into the database (using `rows=0` parameter)
- The connection to the database is still tested and validated
- Each script generates appropriate control files based on the CSV structure

These scripts provide comprehensive testing of both:
1. The database connection (using SQL*Loader)
2. The CSV parsing logic (with detailed validation logs)

This approach allows you to verify both connectivity and data parsing without actually modifying any data in the database.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the CSV parsing and validation in more detail?
