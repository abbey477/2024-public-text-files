## Response:
 I'll create a simple shell script to test database connection with SQL*Loader (sqlldr). SQL*Loader is a bulk data loading utility for Oracle databases that lets you load data from external files into database tables.

Let me create an artifact with multiple examples of shell scripts for testing SQL*Loader connections:

The artifact I've created contains four different shell scripts for testing SQL*Loader database connections:

1. **Basic Connection Test** - A simple script that:
   - Creates a test data file and control file
   - Runs SQL*Loader with minimal options
   - Checks if the connection was successful
   - Displays the log file contents

2. **Connection Test with Timeout** - A more robust script that:
   - Sets a timeout to prevent hanging if the database is unreachable
   - Uses environment variables for connection parameters
   - Includes more detailed error handling for different failure scenarios

3. **Multiple Database Connection Test** - A script for testing connections to several databases:
   - Tests multiple database connections in sequence
   - Generates a comprehensive connection report
   - Extracts Oracle error messages from the logs
   - Handles different connection strings

4. **TNS Connection Test** - A comprehensive test that:
   - Uses TNS entries from tnsnames.ora
   - Verifies the TNS configuration files are accessible
   - Includes more SQL*Loader options like bad files and discard limits
   - Provides detailed classification of different return codes

Each script demonstrates different aspects of SQL*Loader connection testing with increasing complexity and functionality. You can run any individual test by uncommenting the corresponding function call, or run all tests sequentially.

To use these scripts in your environment, you'll need to:
1. Replace the placeholder usernames, passwords, and database names with your actual credentials
2. Make the script executable with `chmod +x scriptname.sh`
3. Run it with `./scriptname.sh`

Would you like me to explain any specific part of these scripts in more detail?

## Response:
 You're right - we should focus solely on testing the database connection without inserting any data into tables. Let me create a revised shell script that only tests the SQL*Loader connection without actually loading data.

I've revised the shell scripts to focus exclusively on testing the database connection without writing any data to tables. Here are the key techniques used in each example:

1. **Basic Connection Test**:
   - Creates an empty data file
   - Uses `ROWS=0` parameter to prevent loading any data
   - Only checks if SQL*Loader can successfully connect

2. **Connection Test with Timeout**:
   - Sets a timeout to prevent hanging connections
   - Uses the `silent` option to reduce unnecessary output
   - Uses `rows=0` and `skip_unused_columns=true` to ensure no data loading

3. **Multiple Database Connection Test**:
   - Tests connections to multiple databases in sequence
   - Uses the `dual` table (which exists in every Oracle database) for connection testing
   - Creates a connection report with success/failure status

4. **TNS Connection Test**:
   - Tests connection using TNS entries
   - Checks for the existence of tnsnames.ora in standard locations
   - Provides more detailed error reporting based on return codes

5. **SQL*Loader Version Check** (new example):
   - Simply checks that SQL*Loader is available
   - Extracts version information
   - Requires minimal setup to verify the tool itself is working

In all cases, these scripts:
- Never actually load data into any tables
- Use `ROWS=0` to explicitly prevent loading
- Focus solely on establishing and verifying the database connection
- Report success or failure of the connection attempt
- Clean up all temporary files

To use these scripts in your environment:
1. Replace the placeholder credentials with your actual database connection details
2. Make the script executable with `chmod +x script_name.sh`
3. Run it with `./script_name.sh`

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of these connection testing techniques in more detail?
