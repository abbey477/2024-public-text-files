Let me help you with that XML parsing error. It seems you're encountering an issue with a null character (Unicode 0x0) in your XML document, which is not allowed in XML content.

Would you like me to:
1. Help you write code to clean invalid characters from your XML
2. Explain why this error occurs and how to prevent it
3. Help you debug a specific XML file

Let me know what would be most helpful and I can provide more specific guidance!

=====================================================================================

This error occurs because XML has strict rules about valid characters in content. Only these characters are allowed:

- Tab (\u0009)
- Line feed (\u000A) 
- Carriage return (\u000D)
- Characters from \u0020 to \uD7FF
- Characters from \uE000 to \uFFFD
- Characters from \U00010000 to \U0010FFFF

Common causes:
- Null bytes (\u0000) from binary files
- Control characters from text processing
- Invalid Unicode from character encoding issues

Prevention methods:
1. Validate input before XML creation
2. Use XML-safe encoding when reading binary data
3. Implement character filtering during XML generation
4. Set proper character encoding (UTF-8/16) when reading files
5. Use XML escaping for special characters

If validation isn't possible, use a character cleaner like the code provided earlier to sanitize the content before parsing.
