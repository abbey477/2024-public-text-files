I'll create a simple example that demonstrates how to use Java's built-in `java.util.LinkedList<E>` class, which is part of the Java Collections Framework.

I've created an example that demonstrates how to use Java's built-in `java.util.LinkedList<E>` class. This implementation is a doubly-linked list that's part of the Java Collections Framework.

The example covers the following operations:

1. **Basic operations**:
   - Adding elements (at the beginning, end, or specific position)
   - Accessing elements by index or position (first, last)
   - Updating elements
   - Removing elements (from beginning, end, or by value)

2. **Using LinkedList as different data structures**:
   - As a Queue (First-In-First-Out) using `offer()`, `poll()`, and `peek()`
   - As a Stack (Last-In-First-Out) using `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()`

3. **Iteration techniques**:
   - Using enhanced for loops
   - Using Iterator (including safe removal during iteration)

4. **Other operations**:
   - Checking size
   - Finding element indices
   - Clearing the list
   - Checking if the list is empty

Java's `LinkedList` implementation differs from a basic linked list by being doubly-linked (each node has references to both the next and previous nodes), which allows for efficient traversal in both directions and operations at both ends of the list.

The code provides a comprehensive overview of how to use this versatile data structure in different scenarios.
