I'll help you modify your method to properly handle URLConnection, HttpsURLConnection, and HttpURLConnection in a way that works with Java 11's module system. Here's how to structure it:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URLConnection;
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;

public class URLConnectionFactory {
    
    public static URLConnection createConnection(String urlString) throws IOException {
        URL url = new URL(urlString);
        URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
        
        // Configure common settings for all connection types
        connection.setConnectTimeout(5000);
        connection.setReadTimeout(5000);
        
        // Handle HTTP specific settings
        if (connection instanceof HttpURLConnection) {
            HttpURLConnection httpConn = (HttpURLConnection) connection;
            httpConn.setRequestMethod("GET");  // or other method as needed
            httpConn.setDoInput(true);
        }
        
        // Handle HTTPS specific settings
        if (connection instanceof HttpsURLConnection) {
            HttpsURLConnection httpsConn = (HttpsURLConnection) connection;
            // Configure HTTPS specific settings if needed
            // For example, custom SSL context or hostname verifier
        }
        
        return connection;
    }
    
    // Overloaded method with more configuration options
    public static URLConnection createConnection(String urlString, String method, 
            boolean doOutput, int timeout) throws IOException {
        URL url = new URL(urlString);
        URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
        
        connection.setConnectTimeout(timeout);
        connection.setReadTimeout(timeout);
        connection.setDoOutput(doOutput);
        
        if (connection instanceof HttpURLConnection) {
            HttpURLConnection httpConn = (HttpURLConnection) connection;
            httpConn.setRequestMethod(method);
            httpConn.setDoInput(true);
        }
        
        return connection;
    }
    
    // Usage example
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // For HTTP
            URLConnection httpConn = createConnection("http://example.com");
            if (httpConn instanceof HttpURLConnection) {
                HttpURLConnection http = (HttpURLConnection) httpConn;
                int responseCode = http.getResponseCode();
                System.out.println("HTTP Response Code: " + responseCode);
            }
            
            // For HTTPS
            URLConnection httpsConn = createConnection("https://example.com");
            if (httpsConn instanceof HttpsURLConnection) {
                HttpsURLConnection https = (HttpsURLConnection) httpsConn;
                int responseCode = https.getResponseCode();
                System.out.println("HTTPS Response Code: " + responseCode);
            }
            
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

You can also create a more specific version that handles different types of connections:

```java
public class EnhancedURLConnectionFactory {
    
    public static URLConnection getConnection(String urlString) throws IOException {
        return createBaseConnection(urlString);
    }
    
    public static HttpURLConnection getHttpConnection(String urlString) throws IOException {
        URLConnection conn = createBaseConnection(urlString);
        if (!(conn instanceof HttpURLConnection)) {
            throw new IOException("URL does not support HTTP protocol");
        }
        return (HttpURLConnection) conn;
    }
    
    public static HttpsURLConnection getHttpsConnection(String urlString) throws IOException {
        URLConnection conn = createBaseConnection(urlString);
        if (!(conn instanceof HttpsURLConnection)) {
            throw new IOException("URL does not support HTTPS protocol");
        }
        return (HttpsURLConnection) conn;
    }
    
    private static URLConnection createBaseConnection(String urlString) throws IOException {
        URL url = new URL(urlString);
        URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
        
        // Set default configurations
        connection.setConnectTimeout(10000);
        connection.setReadTimeout(10000);
        
        if (connection instanceof HttpURLConnection) {
            HttpURLConnection httpConn = (HttpURLConnection) connection;
            httpConn.setRequestMethod("GET");
            httpConn.setInstanceFollowRedirects(true);
            httpConn.setDoInput(true);
        }
        
        return connection;
    }
}
```

Example usage:

```java
try {
    // Get generic URLConnection
    URLConnection conn = EnhancedURLConnectionFactory.getConnection("https://example.com");
    
    // Get HTTP connection
    HttpURLConnection httpConn = 
        EnhancedURLConnectionFactory.getHttpConnection("http://example.com");
    
    // Get HTTPS connection
    HttpsURLConnection httpsConn = 
        EnhancedURLConnectionFactory.getHttpsConnection("https://example.com");
    
    // Use the connections as needed
    httpConn.setRequestMethod("POST");
    httpConn.setDoOutput(true);
    // ... continue with connection configuration and usage
    
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

This approach:
1. Works with Java 11's module system without requiring additional JVM arguments
2. Properly handles all three connection types (URLConnection, HttpURLConnection, HttpsURLConnection)
3. Provides type safety through specific getter methods
4. Includes basic configuration options that can be customized
5. Handles protocol verification to ensure you get the right type of connection

The code uses only public APIs, so it won't cause module system errors and will be maintainable across Java versions.
