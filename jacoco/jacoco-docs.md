I'll create a comprehensive guide for setting up JaCoCo with Spring Boot using Maven, focusing on the configuration of jacoco-maven-plugin, maven-surefire-plugin, and the org.jacoco.agent JAR.

## Setting Up JaCoCo with Spring Boot and Maven

The configuration I've prepared includes all the necessary elements to properly set up JaCoCo code coverage in a Spring Boot project using Maven. Here's an explanation of the key components:

### 1. JaCoCo Agent Dependency

The `org.jacoco.agent` JAR with the runtime classifier is included as a test dependency, which provides the runtime agent needed for code coverage instrumentation:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
    <artifactId>org.jacoco.agent</artifactId>
    <version>${jacoco.version}</version>
    <classifier>runtime</classifier>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### 2. JaCoCo Maven Plugin Configuration

The plugin is configured with three main execution phases:

- **prepare-agent**: Sets up the JaCoCo agent to collect coverage data during test execution
- **report**: Generates HTML reports after tests are complete
- **check**: Enforces minimum coverage thresholds (70% for both instruction and branch coverage)

### 3. Maven Surefire Plugin Integration

The Surefire plugin is configured to work with JaCoCo by passing the agent parameters through the `surefireArgLine` property:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <argLine>${surefireArgLine}</argLine>
        <!-- ... -->
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### 4. JaCoCo Output File Configuration

The `jacoco.exec` file path is defined in multiple places to ensure consistency:

```xml
<sonar.jacoco.reportPath>${project.basedir}/target/jacoco.exec</sonar.jacoco.reportPath>
```

And again in the plugin configuration:

```xml
<destFile>${project.basedir}/target/jacoco.exec</destFile>
```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Run Tests with Coverage**: `mvn clean test`
2. **Generate Coverage Report**: This happens automatically after tests, but you can also run `mvn jacoco:report`
3. **View Reports**: Open `target/site/jacoco/index.html` in a browser
4. **Enforce Coverage**: The build will fail if coverage drops below 70% when you run `mvn verify`

This setup provides a complete configuration for measuring code coverage in a Spring Boot project with detailed reports and quality enforcement.
